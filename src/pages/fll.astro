                FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a global robotics program that introduces students aged 4-16 to STEM through hands-on, team-based challenges using LEGO robotics kits. 
                Participants learn how to design, build, and program robots to complete themed missions, while also developing critical skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, creativity, and communication.
