Hello! We had a long day yesterday so I am getting the blog post out a little later than usual. At yesterday's meeting, we practiced our pitch and then visited local companies to request sponsorship. We received a lot of positive responses, and everyone we spoke to was very kind and accommodating. Thank you again to everyone we met for your time and attention! It means a lot to us.



We are planning to visit more businesses later this week to pitch again. We are slowly but steadily getting closer to our goal of $5,000 for our team!
