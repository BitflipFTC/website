At Sunday's meeting, we tested the intake and flywheel, continued working on the portfolio, and researched outreach and events.

Today, the FLL students refined mission code, edited their script, worked on a 3D modeled prototype, and started decorating their posterboard that they will bring to competitions. During the FTC meeting, we continued working on the flywheel.
