Good morning! First of all, I wanted to thank Anderson Insurance Associates for their generous donation! We are so grateful for their contribution and taking the time to support us. We also did a shoutout on our Instagram, so be sure to check that out.

Second, we finished filming our first video for our Youtube channel! We will be creating a series that details how to start an FTC robotics team based on our experience with Bitflip. We hope that this will be a helpful resource for anyone trying to start their own team.
