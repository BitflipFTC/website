Yesterday, we had our second meeting with Bitflip Jr. We finished building all of the mission models, went over robot designs, and participated in a teambuilding activity. The team members had to stack plastic cups using a rubber band with pieces of string tied to it; this activity fosters teamwork, planning, and effective communication.

During our FTC meeting, we ordered parts for our robot and finished more thank-you cards to send to our sponsors.
