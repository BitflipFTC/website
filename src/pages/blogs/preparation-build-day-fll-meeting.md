At our meeting last Friday, we unpacked and organized Gobilda parts. We also tuned and tested the flywheel, built the turret, and continued working on the portfolio.

On Saturday, we attended the Build Day at Orange Grove. We had a great time constructing our robot, programming, and testing, as well as seeing other teams innovating.

On Wednesday, our FLL students designed and began building a prototype for their project out of Legos, as well as worked on their project script and coded another mission, in preparation for their upcoming scrimmage on October 18th.
