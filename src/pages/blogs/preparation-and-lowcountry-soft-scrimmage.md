Thank you so much to Orange Grove Robotics for hosting the Lowcountry Soft Scrimmage this past Saturday! We had a great time and loved being able to participate in practice matches against other teams.
<br><br>
Activity on Friday and Saturday:
* Perfecting auto-aim for the turret
* Testing and implementing spindexer code
* Testing combined Opmode
* Testing the robot's ability to shoot using the transfer
* Automating spindexer positions
* Automating intake
* Testing subsystems
* Rewiring parts of the robot and reconfiguring them on the driver station, then labelling ports for easy reconfiguration in the future
* Ensuring the camera properly outputs distance
* Adding temporary parts to the robot, such as a barrier around the spindexer and a ramp leading from the intake to the spindexer
* Improving intake
