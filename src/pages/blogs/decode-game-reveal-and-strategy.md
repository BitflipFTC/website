Yesterday, we watched the DECODE game reveal and discussed robot designs. In order to compete effectively, we will need to build a robot that can take in balls, use a color sensor to aid in ordering them, and throw them into a structure on the field, as well as recognize AprilTags. We brainstormed and researched a few different designs that we could use for our robot. Additionally, we programmed our prototype robot to follow an AprilTag.
