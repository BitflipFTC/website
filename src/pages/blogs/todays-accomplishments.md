At today's meeting, we improved the website, researched grants, and brainstormed ideas for videos we could create for our team Youtube channel. Our hope is that the content we create can both aid other FTC teams and provide credibility for our team so that potential sponsors can see what we are working on. We also designed and signed thank-you cards for our current sponsors to show our gratitude for their support, as well as completed a sponsorship packet for our FLL team, Bitflip Jr. As part of our outreach this year, we are starting this team and mentoring its members. 

We hope to apply for grants soon to acquire additional funding, as well as begin creating content for our Youtube channel.
