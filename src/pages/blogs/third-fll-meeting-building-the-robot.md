At our FLL meeting, we taught the students programming basics. As the season progresses, they will code their own robot so that it can complete the missions all by itself. We also spent a little bit of time on attachments, which are constructions like a caribiner or a one-way gate that are attached to and detached from the robot in order to aid in completing the missions. In our teambuilding exercise, the students were split into two teams and had to build the tallest tower they could in a limited amount of time using only marshmallows and toothpicks. This exercise requires strong communication, teamwork, and strategy.

During our FTC meeting, we continued construction on the robot.
