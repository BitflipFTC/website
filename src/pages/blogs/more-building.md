At our meeting, we continued construction on the robot and were able to drive the finished product. We also weighed the pros and cons of purchasing another chassis so that we can have separate prototyping and competition robots. While the chassis would be expensive (around $500) and require construction and upkeep, it would allow for more rapid prototyping and additional time to program.
