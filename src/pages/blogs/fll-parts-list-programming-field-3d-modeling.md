During our FLL meeting on Wednesday, we discussed the innovation project and decided on a broad topic. We also decided to build a smaller box bot this season and began construction; Additionally, we pseudo coded a few missions and began to build an active attachment that will drop down, pull back a bar as the robot reverses, and lift up again so that the robot can drive away without catching on the mission and breaking it. For our teambuilding exercise, the students paired up into teams of two and completed a maze in which one team member sitting on a plastic roller similar to a dolly gives directions to their blind partner, who is pushing them through the maze.

In today's meeting, we

* 3D modeled the robot more, including the number plate holders

* Tuned the robot heading correction proportional PID controller

* Prepared for autonomous

* Worked on making the robot orient itself towards an AprilTag

* Continued to compile the additional parts list

* Practiced 3D modeling

* Finished building the field
