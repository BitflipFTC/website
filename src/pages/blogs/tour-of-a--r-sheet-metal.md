Thank you so much to everyone at A & R Sheet Metal for taking the time to speak to us on Wednesday about their business and the sheet metal industry! Special thanks to Mr. Jason, who led us on a tour of the facilities and answered all of our questions. Everyone was so kind and gracious, and we were so grateful for this opportunity!
