Unfortunately, we have not been able to meet much this past week due to illness among our members. However, three of our team members met on Saturday. They:
* Began remodeling and refining the robot design
* Discussing new design ideas
* Printing the new hood
* Refining auto aim, drivetrain, shooting, and more
