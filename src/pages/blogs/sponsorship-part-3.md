Today we revisited businesses that we had previously approached for donations. Most of the representatives that we had spoken to last time were unavailable, but we were able to speak to representatives from two companies. The manager of Lowes Foods, whom we met for the first time today, promised to contact us about possibly being able to sponsor us. We were also able to get a picture with Lauren from Nail Inspiration. She was very gracious and kind, making time in her busy schedule for us. We are super grateful to everyone we spoke to today!

Additionally, we started planning out the agenda for the first few Bitflip Jr. FLL meetings. We will play a few icebreakers, teach the kids about robotics, and assign homework to help them retain the new information.
