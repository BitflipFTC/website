Today, we visited another round of companies in our area and pitched to them. As with last time, everyone we met was very polite and kind. Several of the people we spoke to suggested we come back at a different time when their manager would be at that location, so we hope to be able to return to meet them and answer any questions that they may have. We unfortunately had to stop today because we ran out of sponsorship packets, but we will print more and try again another day. 



Happy Fourth of July!
