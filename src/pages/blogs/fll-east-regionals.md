Congratulations to Bitflip Jr. for working so hard at the East Regional competition! We would also like to give a huge thank-you to FRC team 3490 Viper Drive for hosting the event, and thank you to all of the volunteers who made the competition possible! Good luck to the FLL teams that moved on to compete again!
