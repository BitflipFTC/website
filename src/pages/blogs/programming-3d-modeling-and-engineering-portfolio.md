During our meeting on Sunday, we tuned the AprilTag PID controller, discussed placement of the control hub and expansion hub on the robot, tested artifact detection samples in the SDK, and created a Velocity PID opmode for the flywheels. We also began 3D modeling the intake on the robot and started printing the launcher. Additionally, we continued working on the template for the engineering portfolio (thank you so much to TARDIS 5356 for their amazing webinar about this topic!).

On Wednesday, the FLL students discussed designing a sifter that will sift dig site material for the archaeologists and make the process easier and faster. They also made excellent progress on their robot and started learning how to 3D model in TinkerCAD. Next week, they will 3D print name plaques that they designed themselves.
