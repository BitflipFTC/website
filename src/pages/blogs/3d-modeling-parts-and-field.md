At our last two meetings, we spent time 3D modeling parts of the robot, including the shooter, turret, and camera holder. We printed the fourth iteration of our camera holder yesterday, and it was a success. We also compiled a list of parts that we need to order. Additionally, our field came in this week, so we have been working on that as well.
