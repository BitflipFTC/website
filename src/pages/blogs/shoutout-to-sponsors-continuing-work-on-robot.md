First of all, we would like to give a shoutout to the Kimms for their generous donation! We are truly grateful for their support!
<br><br>
During our meetings this week, we discussed and 3D-modeled robot designs in an effort to determine which would be best for the game. We also continued programming the robot, updated the driver station, and added sloth load. Our drivetrain was having drifting issues, but we were able to fix it during one of our meetings.

The FLL students talked about robot designs, the innovation project, and mission strategy, as well as participated in a teambuilding activity that involved instructing human "robots" to play basketball.
