We took last week off because of busy schedules and finals week, but this week we are coming back strong! 
<br><br>
Bitflip Jr.'s meeting (preparing for their qualifier this Saturday):
* Rehearsing their presentation
* Refining and running through their missions
* We made a roster of who will be at the table during which matches and wrote a draft of our weekly email to the FLL families with meeting recaps and important information 
<br><br>
Bitflip's meetings:
* Making progress on building the latest iteration of our robot with aluminum plates that we ordered from Xometry
* 3D printing parts for our robot
