Hey guys! Today we wrote an email to the members of our FLL team, Bitflip Jr., telling them a little bit about what FLL is and providing resources and information so that they can help fundraise. 


Additional accomplishments: 
* Improving the website, especially the FLL page
* Applying for a BAE grant
* Playing with kittens :)
