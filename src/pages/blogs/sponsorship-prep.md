At today's meeting, we focused on preparing to approach local companies and ask for financial support. Here's how we did that:


- We created a page of our sponsorship packet that lists some of the parts we will need for our robot. That way, companies can donate specific materials to us instead of cash.


- We wrote and practiced the pitch for what we will say when we approach companies for sponsorship. That way, we will be prepared and present a professional aesthetic.


- We finalized the list of shops we would like to ask for tours. 


As a side note, we also worked on the script for our first Youtube video!
