                We are Bitflip, a first-year high school robotics team based in Charleston, South Carolina. Our team is comprised of five people—four of us have experience in robotics, and one of us is a beginner. Our members are eager to begin competing in First Tech Challenge, and we aim to go all the way to the World Championship. Because we are starting from scratch, we have created a team name, colors, and logo. We have also developed a website so that anyone who is interested can find information about our team. Furthermore, we are working through the process of creating an FLL team, which we will coach and mentor as part of our outreach efforts.

                    <p>
                        I’m Isabella, I’m sixteen years old, and I have done FIRST robotics for four years and counting. I love music, baking, and doing math in my head when I’m bored. When I graduate, I would love to get a job in applied mathematics at NASA. I love robotics because it has numbers.

                        Hi, I'm Elijah. This is my eighth year of robotics. I'm seventeen, and I am studying to be a mechanical engineer. I am a 4th-year FTC student. My favorite part of robotics is building and designing robots. When I’m not doing robotics, I love playing with my cats.

                        Hi, I am Micah, a fifteen-year-old eight-year robotics student who is passionate about CAD design and engineering. I hope to go to university and study to be an architect using the skills I have acquired through the FTC program. In my free time, I love woodworking in creative, unique, and original ways.
