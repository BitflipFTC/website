                    We are Bitflip, a first-year high school robotics team based in Charleston, South Carolina. Our team is comprised of five peopleâ€“four of us have experience in robotics, and one of us is a beginner. Our members are eager to begin competing in First Tech Challenge, and we aim to go all the way to the World Championship. Because we are starting from scratch, we have created a team name, colors, and logo. We have also programmed a website so that anyone who is interested can find information about our team. Furthermore, we are also working through the process of creating an FLL team, which we will coach and mentor as part of our outreach efforts.                 </p>
