            Hi! We are Bitflip, a first-year high school robotics team based in West Ashley, Charleston, South Carolina. 
            We are a team of five: four of us have done robotics before, and we have one new member. 
            Our team is eager to begin competing in First Tech Challenge, and we aim to go all the way to the world championship.
